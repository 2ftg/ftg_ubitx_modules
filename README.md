# ftg_ubitx_modules
An attempt at a modular modified uBITX version  
This is my (OH2FTG) take on the popular uBITX rig.
As such component choices have been made based on my junkbox and personal interests. 
The option for VHF (6m/4m/2m) is also something I desired and plan for.  
Currently the 30MHz LPF, Si5351 VFO, 1st mixer, UI and parts of the audiochain have been built with a combination of ratsnest and manhattan.  
But I want to build most of the other stages, especially the SSB filter and associated amplifiers on etched pcb's.  
I also want to learn how multiboard design works in Altium Designer and the proven uBITX design affords itself to a multiboard modularized design quite well.
