ftg_modular_ubitx

I want to extend the uBITX design quite a bit. 
The traditional 45MHz 1st IF and 11MHz 2nd IF for SSB are retained.
However as I'm planing on including native 6m, 4m and 2m functionality in the rig with high side LO injection, I also want native FM receive and preferably also transmit.
The easy way to do this is to add some switching afther the 45MHz IF filter and IF amplifiers.
Thusly the 45MHz IF can be mixed down to 455kHz with a crystal oscillator and a traditional FM IF chip like SA605 can be used.
Using a chip with 455kHz IF for FM also allows adding a separate 455kHz AM detector for some broadcast band and airband listening. 

The VHF mods for the 1st mixer board includes a DPDT relay for switching the mixer output between the HF 30MHz LPF and the bi-directional VHF amplifier.
The VHF bidiamp is made from MAR-6 and MAR-3 MMIC's switched with HSMP-3820 PIN-diodes, the idea is copied from the N6QW 20m MMIC transceiver.
Following the amplifer is a 49-150MHz bandpass filter with enhanced 45MHz notch. 
Notching out the 45Mhz should offer enough suppression for 45Mhz products for amplifying 50MHz for transmit.

The 1st IF bidiamp is done with BFR93A VHF transistors instead of 2N3904 to get good 45MHz gain without distortion.
special precations need to be observed due to their 5GHz fT compared to the 300MHz fT of 2N3904. 
The amp is configured for 12dB gain in both directions.
This board includes the IF switch relay for switching between 12MHz SSB IF strip and the 455kHz AM/FM IF strip.

Due to the build having a separate FM IF with it's detectors, the 12MHz SSB product detector audio output is swithced with a 74HC4052 dual 1p4t MUX.

The 12MHz SSB filter board is done without any large mods. 
A provision for adding trimmers to the SSB filter caps is added as it costs nothing. 
The 12MHz bidiamp is almost stock with it's 2N3904 transistors configured for 12dB gain. 
The RX path has been modified for variable gain. 

The 2nd mixer is a Mini-Circuits RMS-2. While overkill with it's 5-1000MHz coverage, I have some 
in my junkbox and the pinout is similar to ADE-1, RMS-1 and so on. 

The RMS-2 product detector is followed by a 74HC4052 MUX for switching the audio output to the audio amplifier chain between SSB/CW, FM and AM.
Same goes for transmit.

The final audio amplifier is the stock TDA2822, but fed via a 9V regulator. 
The preamp stages are built with NE5534 op-amps instead of 2N3904's. 
The audio stages include a 300Hz high pass filter for getting rid of low frequencies and potential CTCSS noise.

Microphone amplification is done with a eBay sourced SSM2167 microphone pre-amplifier and compressor. 
The compressed audio is then further buffered and fed to the balanced modulator or FM modulator.
